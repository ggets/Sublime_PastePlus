# PastePlus Sublime

  A plugin to allow copying paths from file(s) in Windows Explorer.


## Requirements:

* Dependencies:
* * python-pywin32

## Features:
* Paste paths of local files from by copying a file in Windows Explorer.

* By default binds to **CTRL+ALT+V**. When pasting, if the contents of the clipboard are not a 'file' copied in Windows Explorer, the original **Paste** command is executed. This behaviour is to enable better experience if you replace the default pasting shorcut **CTRL+V**.

## Installation

### Sublime Package Control

You can install Paste Plus using the excellent [Package Control][] package manager for Sublime Text:

1. Open "Package Control: Install Package" from the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Super` + `Shift` + `P`).
2. Select the "Paste Plus" option to install Paste Plus.

### Git Installation

To install manually using Git, clone to your "Packages" directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggets/Sublime_PastePlus.git "Paste Plus"
```
