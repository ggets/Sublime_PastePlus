# PastePlus Sublime


# Requirements:

* Dependencies:
* * python-pywin32

# Features:
* Paste URIs of local files from by copying a file in Windows Explorer.

* By default binds to **CTRL+ALT+V**. When pasting, if the contents of the clipboard are not a 'file' copied in Windows Explorer, the original **Paste** command is executed. This behaviour is to enable better experience if you replace the default pasting shorcut **CTRL+V**.
